            Welcome to the website! Maniac Bridge here, thanks to github I was able to create and host this for free! 
            I will be adding new games and other webtoys and features to the website frequently. 
            I hope you enjoy the site, and expect MAJOR improvements to it over time.
            Next major update should be in a while, but until then enjoy the site!
            You can e-mail me at maniacbridge115@gmail.com for questions, issues, or comments
