        <p> Hi! Maniac Bridge here, I would just like to say a few things. 1. I am currently undergoing a project with a friend to create a life simulator game. Stay tuned for more details! 2. The "massive update" will be a while from now, but it will completely change the look of the website (But Maniac! Its pretty without color or design! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA no its not). Thanks for your time!</p>
